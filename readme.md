# Short summary
Boiler plate code to get you (more so future me) up and running with a 2d project.


## Current features
- ES6 Modules (less things clogging up global scope and only one script to include in your html)
- Fixed timestep gameloop with interpolation support
- Resizable buffer to draw on for consistency across devices
- Scaling with constant aspect ratio
- Built in vector library
- Global mouse and keyboard objects with updated states
- Extendable classes for rectangles, circles, and more to come 
- misc. tools (such as linear interpolation and rotation)
